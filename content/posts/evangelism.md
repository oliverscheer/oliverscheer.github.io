# My learnings about being an evangelist

1. Evanglism is nothing religious.  
It is about sharing the good message about things that you are interested in.

1. You are on a stage.  
Entertain people. Don't kill people with boring PowerPoints. Do Demos, tell stories. Use PowerPoint wisely.

1. Demos. Demos. Demos.  
Do live coding and demos when you are 110 % sure. Have always video records as a backup.

1. Before you do a talk, blog about it.  
This helps you to structure your talk, and content. And is a brilliant give away to your audience.

1. Live Coding  
Only do it, when you are 110 % familiar with what you are doing and the tools you are using. Everything can happen and will happen.
