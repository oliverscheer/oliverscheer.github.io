## Who am I and how I work

## Personal

My name is Oliver Scheer. I'm living close to Munich, Germany.

I am proud dad of 3 girls and husband of a wonderful, working woman.

### Work

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft in a department called Commercial Software Engineering (CSE). I'm working now for almost 15 years at Microsoft in different developer related roles, including Developer Evangelism and Software Engineering.

### Worktime

I work approximately 95% from home or anyway, but I really like to travel for work related projects.

My normal work time is during school and kindergarten time. In normal times without Covid-19.

| Day               | Const Worktime      |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Monday - Thursday | static 8:00 - 15:30 |
| Friday            | static 8:00 - 13:00 |

I'm also work outside this hours, but this depends on a lot of different factors. If you require my time, I need an appointment in my calendar at least a day ahead and I promise to do my best to be there in time or give you at least an alternative option.

This is a living document, send me feedback or change request, if you like.

### Email

I'm answering emails that have a clear ask/action item normally within 24 hours.

In case I'm not available you will receive an Out-Of-Office message.

In case you did not receive an answer from me, but expected one, I couldn't identify a task for me, so please retry.
